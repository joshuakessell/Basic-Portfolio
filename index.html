        <p>My name is Joshua, and I am a technical support professsional with over 10 years' experience in issue resolution and supporting order fulfillment teams. I'm currently transitioning towards a more techincal side of my career, training as a Junior Web Developer in an SMU-taught course.</p>

I have a broad spectrum of competencies: from customer-facing roles, tech-support roles, to order fufillment operations and logistics, I understand the workings of what makes an entire business operate.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>My core competencies currently include (but are not limited to): HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, SQL, Java, Javascript, and C++.</p>
